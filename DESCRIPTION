Description: Linnorm is an R package for the analysis of RNA-seq, 
	scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq count data or any large scale count data. Its 
	main function is to normalize and transform these datasets for 
	parametric tests. Examples of parametric tests include using limma 
	for differential expression analysis or differential peak detection, 
	or calculating Pearson correlation coefficient for gene correlation
	study. Linnorm can work with raw count, CPM, RPKM, FPKM and TPM. 
	Additionally, Linnorm provides the RnaXSim function for the 
	simulation of RNA-seq raw counts for the evaluation of differential
	expression analysis methods. RnaXSim can simulate RNA-seq dataset
	in Gamma, Log Normal, Negative Binomial or Poisson distributions.
